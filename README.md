# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Tasks (Chinese Adaptation)

This repository contains **Chinese-localized versions** of two experimental tasks originally developed by Norbury et al. (2024, *Science Advances*) for studying cognitive mechanisms underlying components of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

## Overview
The project includes:
1. **Goal-Setting Game** — a gamified reward–effort decision-making task based on behavioral activation therapy principles.  
2. **Causal Attribution Test** — a scenario-based attribution task adapted from the cognitive restructuring component of cognitive therapy.

This repository provides **Chinese-language versions** of these tasks, adapted for local research use and integrated with a backend for data collection.

## My Contributions
- Translated all front-end materials and instructions into **Chinese** to support experiments with Chinese-speaking participants.
- Implemented a **custom backend server** to securely log behavioral and demographic data.
- Adapted both tasks for research with **clinical populations (major depression and schizophrenia)** to investigate how cognitive and behavioral components of CBT differentially influence underlying cognitive mechanisms.
